# Recommendation System Analysis

This repository contains code for a recommendation system analysis. The code analyzes user behavior and provides personalized video recommendations based on a synthetic dataset. The system aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction while considering their interests and preferences.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of the following components:

1. **Data Generation**: The code generates a synthetic dataset of user video-watching behavior. It creates videos with various attributes such as title, duration, view count, likes, dislikes, shares, comments, genre, and uploader. The dataset serves as input for the recommendation system.

2. **Recommendation System**: The recommendation system utilizes the generated dataset to provide personalized video recommendations to users. It applies the TF-IDF vectorization technique to create a similarity matrix based on video titles. Using cosine similarity, the system finds the most similar videos to those watched by a specific user and assigns engagement scores to determine the recommendations. The recommendations are generated for each user, taking into account their past viewing behavior and interests.

3. **Analysis and Results**: The code includes an analysis section that evaluates the performance of the recommendation system over time. It tracks metrics such as user engagement scores, number of video views, unique video types, and the presence of dangerous videos in both watched and recommended categories. The analysis provides insights into user behavior, system effectiveness, and the potential impact of dangerous content recommendations.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`.
2. Execute the code.
3. The code will generate a synthetic dataset, apply the recommendation algorithm, and display the analysis and results.

## Results and Insights

The code generates a series of graphs and metrics that provide insights into the recommendation system's performance. Some notable results and insights include:

- **Dangerous Videos**: The code analyzes the presence of dangerous videos in both watched and recommended categories. It tracks the number of dangerous videos watched and recommended by users over time, providing insights into potential risks associated with the recommendations.

- **Engagement Scores**: The code calculates engagement scores for each video based on metrics such as likes, dislikes, shares, and comments. It analyzes the average engagement scores over time, providing insights into user preferences and the effectiveness of the recommendation algorithm.

- **Unique Video Types**: The code tracks the number of unique video types watched by users over time. This metric helps assess the diversity of content consumed by users and the system's ability to recommend a wide range of video types.

- **Variance of Recommendations**: The code calculates the variance in recommended videos for each user over time. It provides insights into the diversity and consistency of recommendations and how they evolve throughout the simulation.

The graphs and metrics generated by the code offer valuable information for evaluating and fine-tuning the recommendation system, ensuring it delivers personalized and engaging content to users while mitigating potential risks.
